## üîç Check Node.js Installation

Before running the test, verify that Node.js is installed:

```
node -v
```
If you see a version number (e.g., v16.20.0), you're good to go.

If not, install Node.js using the following commands:
```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```
üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the test on your Evernode server.

**1. Create a Directory for the Test**
```
mkdir ~/pow-test
```


**2. Set Directory Permissions**
Set the permissions to allow read, write, and execute access for the user:

```
chmod 700 ~/pow-test
```
**3. Navigate to the Directory**
Move into the newly created directory:

```
cd ~/pow-test
```

**4. Create the Test Script File**
Create an empty JavaScript file named local_pow_test.js
```
touch local_pow_test.js
```

**5. Add the Test Script**
Open the local_pow_test.js file in a text editor (e.g., nano) and paste the test script into it:
```
nano local_pow_test.js
```

**6. Run the Test**
Execute the test using Node.js:
```
node local_pow_test.js
```
