Reputation POW Test
This repository contains a self-test for nodes to measure their Proof-of-Work (POW) performance, which is essential for running the Evernode Reputation Contract.

Setup Instructions
Follow the steps below to set up and run the test on your Evernode server.

1. Create a Directory for the Test
bash
mkdir ~/pow-test
2. Set Directory Permissions
Set the permissions to allow read, write, and execute access for the user.

bash
chmod 700 ~/pow-test
3. Navigate to the Directory
bash
cd ~/pow-test
4. Create the Test Script File
Create an empty JavaScript file named local_pow_test.js.

bash
touch local_pow_test.js
5. Add the Test Script
Open the local_pow_test.js file in a text editor (e.g., nano) and paste the test script into it.

bash
nano local_pow_test.js
Note: Ensure you have the correct script content to paste into the file. If you need the script, refer to the relevant documentation or contact the repository maintainer.

6. Run the Test
Execute the test using Node.js:
